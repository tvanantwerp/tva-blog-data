# The Funding of the Top Ten US Think Tanks and Discussion Thereof on Wikipedia

These data are a brief survey of the funding of the top ten US think tanks according to the [Think Tanks and Civil Society Program](http://gotothinktank.com/) from their [2013 index](http://gotothinktank.com/dev1/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GoToReport2013.pdf). I've included the total revenues from the most recent [IRS Form 990](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-990,-Return-of-Organization-Exempt-From-Income-Tax-) I could find for each think tank, as well as the length of the discussion about each think tank's funding on its [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) page. I've also noted the count of specifically mentioned funders by category.

This short survey was conducted as part of an attempt to quantify the use of discussions of a think tank's funders as an attempt to discredit their publications by association with unpopular individuals and/or groups.

These data are used in this blog post: [Think Tank Funding and Guilt by Association](http://www.tomvanantwerp.com/think-tank-funding-guilt-association/).
